  <h3>Privacy policy</h3>
  <p>This service is committed to protecting your privacy. Here is how information is collected and used by the service.</p>

  <h4>Information collected</h4>

  <p>When you authorize the service with Twitter and Pocket, the service collects your profile details for identification and tokens to be able to pull tweets you have faved and send them to Pocket. The scopes of the tokens are limited to just what they are needed for. As an example, Fave can only read your tweets and can't post anything on your behalf. Because this authorization is done once, these tokens are stored to make the service continually work for you.</p>

  <p>When you login, a tiny piece of information (called cookies) is stored on your browser for authentication purpose. These cookies only last during the browsing session and does not contain any sensitive data about you.</p>

  <p>You can delete your account on Fave at any time. This will completely remove all stored data related to you from the system.</p>

  <h4>Information disclosure</h4>

  <p>We will not give, sell, rent, or loan any information related to you to any third party. We may provide non-personal statistics about the service use, traffic patterns, and related metrics to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.</p>

  <h4>Changes to policy</h4>

  <p>We may change or supplement this Privacy Policy from time to time and we will post revised versions of this Policy on the Site.</p>

  <h4>Contact information</h4>

  <p>All questions and concerns about your privacy can be sent to kehers@gmail.com</p>
